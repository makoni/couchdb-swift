			@Step {
				Add `CouchDBClient` as a Swift Package dependency.

			}
			
			@Step {
				Here's an example app.
				
				@Code(name: "main.swift", file: macOSTutorial-1.swift)
			}
			
			@Step {
				Import `CouchDBClient`.
				
				@Code(name: "main.swift", file: macOSTutorial-2.swift)
			}
			
			@Step {
				Create a CouchDBClient object, define database name and create a worker to perform requests.
				
				@Code(name: "main.swift", file: macOSTutorial-3.swift)
			}
			
			@Step {
				Define a model for your CouchDB document. It should conform to the `CouchDBRepresentable` protocol.
				
				@Code(name: "main.swift", file: macOSTutorial-4.swift)
			}
			
			@Step {
				Insert a document into your database. After inserting CouchDBClient will update `_id` and `_rev` values of your document with the values from CouchDB. 
				
				@Code(name: "main.swift", file: macOSTutorial-5.swift)
			}
			
			@Step {
				Here's an example of updating the document. CouchDBClient will also update the `_rev` value of your document with the value from CouchDB after saving. 
				
				@Code(name: "main.swift", file: macOSTutorial-6.swift)
			}
			
			@Step {
				Getting a document by its `_id` from a database with that method will parse JSON into your model if you provide it as a generic type.
				
				@Code(name: "main.swift", file: macOSTutorial-7.swift)
			}
			
			@Step {
				Deleting a document from a database is also easy. 
				
				@Code(name: "main.swift", file: macOSTutorial-8.swift)
			}
			
			@Step {
				More examples can be found in CouchDBClientTests.swift in the lib sources.
